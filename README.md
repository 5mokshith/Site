# Learn Programming & Computer Science

This project is a **learning platform** designed to help students master programming languages and computer science topics. It categorizes content based on the learner's experience level: **Beginner, Mediocre, Advanced, and Ultimate**. The platform integrates **handpicked educational videos** using `iframe` tags, ensuring a structured and guided learning experience.

## Features

✅ **Level-Based Learning** – Users can choose their expertise level:
* **Beginner** – Basics of programming and computer science.
* **Mediocre** – Intermediate concepts and problem-solving.
* **Advanced** – Deep dive into algorithms, data structures, and advanced topics.
* **Ultimate** – Expert-level content, including real-world projects and best practices.

✅ **Embedded Video Lessons** – Curated educational videos using `iframe` tags for seamless streaming.

✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – A structured layout for easy navigation.
